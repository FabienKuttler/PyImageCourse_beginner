# Image processing for beginners

This repository contains a set of Jupyter notebooks to learn how to do basic image processing using Python and the scientific packages Numpy, Scikit-image, Matplotlib and Pandas.

The material assumes no pre-existing knowledge in programming but some familiarity with concepts of image processing. The goal of the course is NOT to learn all the details of Python, but to reach as fast as possible the ability to write short image processing scripts. The course therefore focuses only on essential knowledge and is not at all *exhaustive*.

Feel free to re-use this material to learn or to teach image processing. If you think some changes are needed, please use the issue tracker to discuss them, as the classical pull request system is not yet ideal for Jupyter Notebooks.
